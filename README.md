### Project Area Brief

The Charcoal Production Site Monitoring Service is a web-based platform for visualizing the spatial distribution of charcoal production sites, thereby facilitating forest degradation monitoring in the Savanah woodland araea of West Gonja District. Very high-resolution imagery from Planet Scope and remote sensing data from SRTM-DEM and Landsat 8 is used to identify charcoal kilns and the production of tree cover density maps. The information will aid in the monitoring of tree cover loss for estimating carbon emissions and for district-level land use planning purposes.

### Data and Data Processing

We compiled a dataset of high-resolution imagery from the Planet archive to provide annual
coverage of the woodlands of the study area for each year between 2018 and 2020. The
dataset included 65 multispectral PlanetScope images (3 m), orthorectified, radiance, and
radiometric, geometric and atmospherically corrected (Level 3B) (PlanetLabs Inc, 2019) with
cloud coverage below 5 % acquired window from March to May. The images provided annual
coverage of the charcoal production zones of the study area for each year between 2018 and
2020.<br>The woodlands of the study area were identified in a mask created created using supervised clasification of landsat 8 images .<br>
Field campaign carried out by CERSGIS in November 2020. Guided by the information obtained
from the analysis of the high-resolution imagery, field crew visited active kilns, kilns under
construction and recent kiln scars in charcoal production zones of the study area. At each
location, they registered the location and dimensions of the kiln or kiln scar. A total of 118 sites
were visited.
