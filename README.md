### Project Area Brief

The Charcoal Production Site Monitoring Service is a web-based platform for visualizing the spatial distribution of charcoal production sites, thereby facilitating forest degradation monitoring in the study area. Very high-resolution imagery from Planet Scope and remote sensing data from SRTM-DEM and Landsat 8 is used to identify charcoal kilns and the production of tree cover density maps. The information will aid in the monitoring of tree cover loss for estimating carbon emissions and for district-level land use planning purposes.
